Steps to get mysql on the SolarSPELL:
1. Add the following lines to /etc/resolv.conf:
   nameserver 8.8.8.8
   nameserver 8.8.4.4

2. Replace the file /etc/apt/sources.list on the pi with the one in this directory.  It includes a new link to a 
working mirror site as of 2/24/18.

3. Connect the SolarSPELL to the internet.  In order to do this, I had to disconnect my wifi and plug the SolarSPELL 
directly into my modem using an ethernet cable.

4. Run the following:
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client

5. Set up mysql root user password - I used raspberry for consistency.

Once mysql is set up on the pi:
1. Replace the my.cnf file in /etc/mysql directory with the one in this directory.  

// We can remove this step (2) and change the path in step 3.
2. Place the setupdb.sql and testdbinfo.txt files in the /var/log/apache2 directory.  The setupdb.sql file is a small script to create a table and then pull data from the testdbinfo.txt file to create records.

3. Run the following commands:
   mysql -uroot -praspberry -e "create database UserData"
   mysql -uroot -praspberry < /var/log/apache2/setupdb.sql
   // OR
   mysql -uroot -praspberry < /home/pi/setup/mysql/setupdb.sql
   
4. You can test to see if the database and table is properly created and populated by doing the following:
   mysql -uroot -p UserData
      enter password raspberry when prompted & you will get the mysql prompt
   select * from UserLogInfo;
      you should see 6 results
