Steps to get mysql on the SolarSPELL:
1. Add the following lines to /etc/resolv.conf:
   nameserver 8.8.8.8
   nameserver 8.8.4.4

2. Replace the file /etc/apt/sources.list on the pi with the one in this directory.  It includes a new link to a 
working mirror site as of 2/24/18.

3. Connect the SolarSPELL to the internet.  In order to do this, I had to disconnect my wifi and plug the SolarSPELL 
directly into my modem using an ethernet cable.

4. Run the following:
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client

5. Set up mysql root user password - I used raspberry for consistency.
